# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-04)

**Core value:** Every package in the monorepo has clear, consistent, useful documentation that serves both human developers and AI agents working on the codebase.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: VitePress 1.6.4 chosen over mkdocs (maintenance mode since Nov 2025) and Zensical (alpha)
- [Init]: markdownlint-cli2 for README linting; lychee for link checking in CI
- [Init]: Existing apps/gui/scripts/deploy-bunny.mjs to be adapted for docs deployment
- [Init]: LIMIT-01 and LIMIT-02 (Known Limitations pattern, deprecation stubs) anchored to Phase 1 styleguide so all package phases inherit the pattern

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research flag] Phase 5 (Skills): Skill description evaluation methodology is not settled; test each skill with 5+ natural language phrasings before shipping
- [Research flag] Phase 3 (Library READMEs): nocap, route66, publisher adapter patterns need codebase deep-read before docs can be written accurately
- [Research gap] VitePress rewrites + relative image paths: validate early in Phase 1 with a real example (e.g., libraries/auditor uses .assets/ relative paths)
